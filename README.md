# EYE

STATUS: PROTOTYPE DO NOT USE
EYE is my personal photo app. It has a few tweaks that are specifically designed for my own particular neurology.

## Flip / Pause

I write backwards, so the primary feature of this app is to flip an image and pause it. 

"Saving" Images is possible in this application (using local-image component currently), but it not the primary feature of this app. 

## Piping

EYE also broadcasts an "updated canvas" event every frame. 

## Usage

```xml
  <e-y-e></e-y-e>
  <e-y-e target="target_eye"></e-y-e>
```
